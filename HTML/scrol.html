<a name="#com"><h3><b>COMPUTER</b></h3></a>
<p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of<br> computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a program.</p>
<a href="#top"><h6><b>GO TO TOP</h6></b></a>
<a name="#cpu"><h5><b>CPU</h5></b></a>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer<br> program byperforming the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>
<a name="#alu"><h5><b>ALU</h5></b></a>
<p>Arithmetic logic unit, a digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise logical operations</p>
<a name="#pro"><h3><b>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</b></h5></a>
<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming <br>languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
<a name="#c"><h5><b>C</b></h5></a>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, <br>while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical <br>machine instructions.</p>
<a name="#c++"><h5><b>C++</b></h5></a>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing <br>facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>

<a name="#dbms"><h3><b>DBMS</b></h3></a>
<p>A database is an organized collection of data.[1] It is the collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views, and other objects. <br>The data are typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, <br>such as modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.</p>
<a name="#rd"><h5><b>RDBMS</b></h5></a>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented <br>by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2016, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational<br> database model.</p>
<a name="#oo"><h5><b>OODBMS</b></h5></a>
<p>An object database (also object-oriented database management system, OODBMS) is a database management system in which information is <br>represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases <br>which are table-oriented. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.</p>
<a name="#hd"><h5><b>HDBMS</b></h5></a>
<p>A DBMS is said to be hierarchical, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply represents the <br>data using parent-child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing/storing data and still some organizations are using this.<br> It follows one to many relationship. i.e. All parents can have more than one child, but each child should have only one parent.</p>
<a name="#nw"><h5><b>NWDBMS</b></h5></a>
<p>The acronym NWDBMS has a life path number 3. The life path number three implies that you posses numerous abilities and have <br>a positive nature with an awesome readiness to learn.</p>
